<p>Im hopping to learn a lot in html&css. Like knowing more on my github account that i had for four years and i didnt know nothing about.</p>
<p>In the mean time I can learn twice as much I did on git pull, git add, and git clone in the bash.</p>
<p> Some good tricks and tools that are going to help me in the future.
